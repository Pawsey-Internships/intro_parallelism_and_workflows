An optimal allocation is a balance between the speedup and cost (node hours or service units).

| Cores | Nodes | Walltime (hours) | Cost (Node hours) |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 128   | 8     | 11.2             | 90                |
| 256   | 16    | 4.4              | 70                |
| 512   | 32    | 2.1              | 67                |
| **1024**  | **64**    | **1.0**              | **64**                |
| 2048  | 128   | 0.91             | 116               |
| 4096  | 256   | 0.75             | 192               |

**Walltime:** The time elapsed as read from a "clock on the wall".

On a Nimbus instance or your own machine, the ideal configuration is the one that gets your work done the fastest.
