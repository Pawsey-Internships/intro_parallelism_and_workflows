### Why Parallel Computing?

* In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted (from 3 data points) that semiconductor density would double every 18 months. ​
​* Amazingly, his prediction held.​

​But Moore's law has its limits:​

As device dimensions shrink, controlling the flow of electrical current becomes increasingly tricky. ​
*	Semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since 2010, below the pace predicted by Moore's law.  

We also encounter challenges in power efficiency:

*	A higher CPU clock speed generally requires a higher power draw.​
*	CPU power consumption increases at a rate greater than increases in CPU frequency. ​

**Solution:** Use multiple simpler processors.​

> By using multiple simpler processes, we can access more computing power without increasing semiconductor density and the (proportional) amount of required electrical power.
