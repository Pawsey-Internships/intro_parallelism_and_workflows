*	Parallel algorithms and data processing pipelines usually take more time to implement compared to their serial equivalents.​
*	They are also often **much** more complex (and harder to debug).​
*	Even when understood, they usually require more effort (time) to maintain.​

For one-off tasks, it might be more time efficient just to leave your computer running overnight...​

…but computational research tasks are rarely one-off.
