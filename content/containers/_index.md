# Containers

*	Containers are packages containing all the elements needed to run a process in any computing environment.
*	This allows for the portability of code between different computers, from your laptop to a Nimbus instance or Topaz.
*	They also support the reproducibility of results that depend on specific software versions.
*	Loosely speaking, a container replaces the 'userland' of the **host** operating system with 'userland' on another operating system - which has access to the devices and computes the power of the host device.
*	There is some performance overhead associated with containers. 
*	But for short-to-medium-term projects (like an internship!) time saved troubleshooting is well worth the tradeoff.
